Welcome to the terminal community! We are a community of terminal users and terminal scripters. It doesnt matter which terminal you use, as we all unite here. 

The terminal's goal is to interact with the computer, without interacting with the GUI (Graphical User Interface). The terminal is also the CLI, Command Line Interface. 

The terminal user is someone who uses the terminal regularly, and The terminal scripter is someone who uses terminal scripts like Batch files, or Shell. 

This is our main github repository.
